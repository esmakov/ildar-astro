<!-- Takes glob import [imagepath:string, {}] and returns an array of image paths, starting at the substring() index --><!-- Cut off "../../../public" from relative path needed for glob import.
It's a dumb hacky workaround because rollup breaks the image paths after bundling, and
won't bundle them if you initially set them to the final build path made by Esbuild -->
